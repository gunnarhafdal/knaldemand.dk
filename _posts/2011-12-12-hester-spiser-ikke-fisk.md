He's hungry.

So very hungry.

He's been eating grass but that feeling of hunger isn't going away. It is like the grass isn't enough anymore. That he needs something else to sate his hunger.

Something meaty.

So he goes out to find something meaty to eat. But where can he find such a thing?

The forest sounds like a good place to start looking. He has no idea why he thinks that but he trusts his instincts. His instincts has served him well in the past.

So off into the forest he goes. To find some meaty food. Maybe a cat or a fish. A catfish perhaps.

He doesn't really care what he finds to eat, just as long as he will stop being hungry.
